# AgriComm Protocol

_Enabling seamless communication between autonomous farm vehicles._

## What is AgriComm?

AgriComm (Agricultural Communication Protocol) is a modern, open-source standard designed to allow tractors, harvesters, drones, and irrigation robots to communicate, coordinate tasks, and optimize farm operations without human intervention.

## Why AgriComm?

- Real-time synchronization between multiple vehicles.
- Task delegation and load balancing across heterogeneous fleets.
- Support for multi-modal communication: telemetry, video, and sensor data.
- Built-in safety, authentication, and error recovery mechanisms.

## Key Features

1. **Secure Message Exchange:** Encrypted peer-to-peer sessions.
2. **Task Negotiation:** Dynamic assignment of field operations based on vehicle capability.
3. **Fleet Awareness:** Vehicles share positioning, state, and intent to avoid collisions and delays.
4. **Open Architecture:** Compatible with diverse hardware and software stacks.
