# AgriComm Protocol

_Enabling seamless communication between autonomous farm vehicles._

## What is AgriComm?

AgriComm (Agricultural Communication Protocol) is a modern, open-source standard designed to allow tractors, harvesters, drones, and irrigation robots to communicate, coordinate tasks, and optimize farm operations without human intervention.

## Why AgriComm?

- Real-time synchronization between multiple vehicles.
- Task delegation and load balancing across heterogeneous fleets.
- Support for multi-modal communication: telemetry, video, and sensor data.
- Built-in safety, authentication, and error recovery mechanisms.

## Key Features

1. **Secure Message Exchange:** Encrypted peer-to-peer sessions.
2. **Task Negotiation:** Dynamic assignment of field operations based on vehicle capability.
3. **Fleet Awareness:** Vehicles share positioning, state, and intent to avoid collisions and delays.
4. **Open Architecture:** Compatible with diverse hardware and software stacks.

## Get Involved

AgriComm is an open collaboration effort! Visit our [GitHub](https://github.com/agricomm-project) to contribute, propose enhancements, or download the latest specification.

### Why this fixes it:
- No `<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>` tags â†’ the theme handles page structure automatically.
- Only **content** using Markdown (`#`, `##`, lists, links) â€” this flows naturally into the themeâ€™s styling.

---

If you want to keep using *some* HTML inside the content (like `<section>` or `<strong>`), you can, but **keep it minimal** and **avoid structural tags** like `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`, `<header>`, etc.

Would you like me to generate a polished version with a little extra style (like centered title, nice section spacing) to make it feel more like a \"real\" page? ðŸŒŸ  
It'll still fit perfectly into your Jekyll theme!
